# face-detecterz
the best cs1430 project ever


To run the project, we recommend creating a virtual environment and installing all libraries in the requirements.txt file. You can do this easily with pip by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Next, run `python3 repl.py` to be recognized!

The emeddings from the CASIA face dataset are located in embeddings/known, and the faces added to the database during the process are stored in data/embeddings.
